# 🚀 SRIOX - Fast Website Deployment Platform

**Live Demo**: 🌐 [https://sriox.com](https://sriox.com)

SRIOX is a developer-focused platform that allows anyone to deploy their personal or static websites in seconds — using only a ZIP or HTML file. It handles everything from storage to publishing via GitHub and custom subdomain management, so users can focus on content, not infrastructure.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔥 Instant website deployment from ZIP or HTML upload
- 🧠 Auto GitHub integration (storage backend)
- 🌐 Subdomain assignment like `username.sriox.com`
- 🔒 Authentication via Google & Email
- 📁 File preview, status tracking, and history logs
- 🎨 Modern UI with intuitive flow (inspired by self.so)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Node.js, Firebase, GitHub API
- **Storage**: GitHub Repositories
- **Auth**: Firebase Auth (Google & Email)
- **Domain Mapping**: Cloudflare DNS API
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Pages

---

## 🚧 How It Works

1. User signs in (Google or Email)
2. Uploads the web site files
3. App pushes files to GitHub
4. GitHub Pages + DNS auto-connects by cloud fare
5. Website is live at `username.sriox.com`
